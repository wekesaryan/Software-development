# Minimum Viable Product(MVP).

- An MVP is a version of a new product that includes only the essential features necessary to meet the needs of early adopters. 

- It allows teams to test their ideas in the market with minimal resources and gather feedback for further development. 

- Using an MVP approach helps in validating concepts and reducing the risk of developing a product that does not meet market demands.
